2025-06-14,I felt really happy today after a long phone call with my best friend. We talked about our dreams and laughed a lot. It reminded me how important genuine connections are.
2025-06-15,"Today started off rough. I woke up feeling anxious and had trouble focusing during work. Everything felt overwhelming. But in the afternoon, I took a walk in the park and saw some kids playing and laughing. It lifted my mood. Later, I tried meditating for the first time in weeks, and it actually helped me calm down. I’m still not completely okay, but I’m proud of myself for making the effort to feel better."
